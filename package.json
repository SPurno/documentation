The first one is a generic reset file. Many browser interpret the default behavior of html elements differently. By using a general reset CSS file, we can work round this. This file also contains some general styling, such as anchor tag colors, font-sizes, etc. Keep in mind, that these values might be overridden somewhere else in the file.</p>\n<p>\tThe second file contains all of the specific stylings for the page. The file is separated into sections using:</p>\n<pre class=\"css\">\n/* === Header Section === */\nsome code\n/* === Main Section === */\nsome code\n/* === Sidebar Section === */\nsome code\n/* === Footer === */\nsome codeetc, etc.\n</pre>\n<p>\tIf you would like to edit a specific section of the site, simply find the appropriate label in the CSS file, and then scroll down until you find the appropriate style that needs to be edited.</p>\n<p>\tAny images that are placed within the blog section have 5px worth of padding and a light bluish background. If you would like to edit the display of these images, find the following section in the style sheet:</p>\n<pre class=\"css\">\n#primaryContent #blog img {\n   change styles here:\n}\n</pre>\n<p>\t&nbsp;</p>\n"},{"title": "JavaScript","id": "javascript","content": "<p>\tThis theme imports three Javascript files.</p>\n<ol>\n\t<li>\t\tjQuery</li>\n\t<li>\t\tMy custom scripts</li>\n\t<li>\t\tSome plugin</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n\t<li>\t\tjQuery is a Javascript library that greatly reduces the amount of code that you must write.</li>\n\t<li>\t\tMost of the animation in this site is carried out from the customs scripts.
